#Overview

IndefiniteArticle.java is a Java function that returns the indefinite articles "a" or "an" based on a given word or phrase. This code was developed and tested in an android application, but given the libraries used, I'm assuming it will work in plain Java. The code was based on [rigoneri's indefinite article] JavaScript port. His code is a port from the [Lingua::EN::Inflect] Perl module found on [this stackoverflow question]
